  "summary": "On New Year's Eve, Katie, a newlywed 29-year-old, was diagnosed with a rare type of stage 4 kidney cancer, which left her feeling shocked and incredibly alone. Despite her fear, Katie began systemic treatment to reduce the size of her 12 centimeter tumor, resulting in its reduction to 10.5 centimeters. After about six months, surgeons were able to remove the tumor, giving Katie a newfound hope for her future. Throughout this journey, Katie felt a lack of information and support for kidney cancer patients like herself. This led her to create a YouTube channel a year after her diagnosis, providing a platform for her to share her personal journey and useful information about kidney cancer. With the support of her dedicated team of oncologists and surgeons, Katie has gone from feeling lost to empowered, transforming her fear into proactive support for others facing similar experiences."
