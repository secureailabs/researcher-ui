    \n
    <p><strong>Meet John Miller</strong>, a <strong>25-year-old</strong> warrior who has faced the battle of his life with unmatched determination. In January 2022, John's world was turned upside down when he began to experience extreme fatigue, robbing him of the active lifestyle he had always cherished. Little did he know that this fatigue was the first sign of a life-changing diagnosis - <strong>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</strong>.</p>\n
    \n
    <p>John's battle was not just physical but also emotional and financial. Balancing treatment with work was incredibly challenging, but John was fortunate to have a supportive employer who allowed him to work remotely when needed.</p>\n
    \n
    <p>Today, John stands tall as an <strong>AML survivor</strong>, in remission and ready to take on his next challenge – a <strong>5k run</strong>. His journey has not only been about surviving but thriving. He's determined to use this opportunity to give back, to raise funds that will support others who are still in the throes of their own battles against leukemia.</p>\n

    <p><strong>Meet John Miller</strong>, a <strong>25-year-old</strong> warrior who has faced the battle of his life with unwavering hope and determination. In January 2022, John's world was turned upside down when he began to experience extreme fatigue, robbing him of the active lifestyle he had always cherished. Little did he know that this fatigue was the first sign of a life-changing diagnosis - <strong>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>From the moment he received the news, John's determination shone like a beacon of hope. He embarked on an aggressive treatment plan that included grueling rounds of chemotherapy.

    <p>During his treatment, John's physician at Stanford introduced him to <strong>Leukaemia Warriors United</strong>, a beacon of hope and support.
